Recall the adiabatic theorem in \autoref{section:annealing}, which states that a system in a ground state will remain in the ground state if the system Hamiltonian is changed slowly. Conversely, if the system Hamiltonian is changed suddenly, the system would remain in the same state that it was in \cite{GriffithsSchroeter2018}. Using this we can explore the intermediate states of D-wave's quantum annealing and compare them with the intermediate states of Neural Network Quantum States to quantify the similarities between the two processes.
