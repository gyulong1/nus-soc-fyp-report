\section{Motivation}
The quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problem can represent various types of combinatorial optimisation problems and has vast applications in both operational research and industry~\cite{b1}. Most problems that involve choosing a set of binary decisions to optimise an objective function can be expressed as a QUBO problem. Examples include the max-cut problem, knapsack problem, or even problems with more complex constraints, such as the travelling salesman problem \cite{b10}. However, QUBO problems are NP-hard and are extremely hard to solve efficiently~\cite{barahona1982computational,b1}. Traditionally, QUBO-solving methods are specialised for a specific problem domain to leverage each problem domain's unique characteristics, limiting the versatility and portability of QUBO-solving methods~\cite{b5}.

The QUBO problem shares similarities with the Ising model in Physics, where the spin variables are either $-1$ or $1$, instead of the binary variables used in QUBO. The two models are equivalent, and the correspondence between the QUBO problem and the Ising model has opened the doors to solving QUBO problems with quantum computational methods~\cite{b5}. The equivalence enhances the problem domains that could be modelled as QUBO problems and allows for QUBO problems to be solved by more general quantum-inspired solving methods~\cite{b5}.

With a broad range of classical and quantum-inspired methods available to tackle QUBO problems, it is imperative to consolidate and benchmark existing QUBO-solving solvers to highlight their performance when solving different kinds of QUBO problems across a range of problem sizes.

\section{Objectives}
In the first section of the report, we aim to measure the performance of 3 quantum-inspired QUBO-solving solvers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Quantum Annealing
    \item Neural Network Quantum States
    \item Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
\end{enumerate}
We will also use classical solvers as a baseline for comparison with quantum-inspired solvers. We will explore two classical solvers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{3}
    \item Fixstars Amplify QUBO Solver
    \item GUROBI Optimizer
\end{enumerate}

%QUBOs are not always effective in practice, though. In particular, they cannot directly:

%Support common real-world situations, such as continuous variables (e.g., prices, commodity flow)
%Support constraints (e.g., max/mins, price cannot exceed a certain value)
%Prove optimality (e.g., you can’t be sure you’ve identified the best solution)

For each solver, we will calculate the success rate (probability of solving optimally) and normalised energy (relative performance of candidate solution) across QUBO problems of different types and sizes. More details of the solvers and performance metrics are available in \autoref{review} and \autoref{methodology}.

In the second section of the report, we will further explore how Neural Network Quantum States can be used to simulate the quantum annealing process to solve QUBO problems. We systematically compare two neural network architectures and three different training algorithms highlighted in \autoref{nnqsresults} for Neural Network Quantum States.

The results of the study will allow us to better understand the current landscape of these quantum-inspired QUBO solvers and how they compare to state-of-the-art classical commercial solvers.
