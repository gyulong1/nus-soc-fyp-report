abstract={Recently, inspired by quantum annealing, many solvers specialized for unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems have been developed. For further improvement and application of these solvers, it is important to clarify the differences in their performance for various types of problems. In this study, the performance of four quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem solvers, namely D-Wave Hybrid Solver Service (HSS), Toshiba Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM), Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA), and simulated annealing on a personal computer, was benchmarked. The problems used for benchmarking were instances of real problems in MQLib, instances of the SAT-UNSAT phase transition point of random not-all-equal 3-SAT (NAE 3-SAT), and the Ising spin glass Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. Concerning MQLib instances, the HSS performance ranked first; for NAE 3-SAT, DA performance ranked first; and regarding the SK model, SBM performance ranked first. These results may help understand the strengths and weaknesses of these solvers.},

abstract = {Quantum(-inspired) annealers show promise in solving combinatorial optimisation problems in practice. There has been extensive researches demonstrating the utility of D-Wave quantum annealer and quantum-inspired annealer, i.e., Fujitsu Digital Annealer on various applications, but few works are comparing these platforms. In this paper, we benchmark quantum(-inspired) annealers with three combinatorial optimisation problems ranging from generic scientific problems to complex problems in practical use. In the case where the problem size goes beyond the capacity of a quantum(-inspired) computer, we evaluate them in the context of decomposition. Experiments suggest that both annealers are effective on problems with small size and simple settings, but lose their utility when facing problems in practical size and settings. Decomposition methods extend the scalability of annealers, but they are still far away from practical use. Based on the experiments and comparison, we discuss the advantages and limitations of quantum(-inspired) annealers, as well as the research directions that may improve the utility and scalability of the these emerging computing technologies.},

This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems.}
