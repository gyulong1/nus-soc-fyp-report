abstract={Recently, inspired by quantum annealing, many solvers specialized for unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems have been developed. For further improvement and application of these solvers, it is important to clarify the differences in their performance for various types of problems. In this study, the performance of four quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem solvers, namely D-Wave Hybrid Solver Service (HSS), Toshiba Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM), Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA), and simulated annealing on a personal computer, was benchmarked. The problems used for benchmarking were instances of real problems in MQLib, instances of the SAT-UNSAT phase transition point of random not-all-equal 3-SAT (NAE 3-SAT), and the Ising spin glass Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. Concerning MQLib instances, the HSS performance ranked first; for NAE 3-SAT, DA performance ranked first; and regarding the SK model, SBM performance ranked first. These results may help understand the strengths and weaknesses of these solvers.},

abstract = {Quantum(-inspired) annealers show promise in solving combinatorial optimisation problems in practice. There has been extensive researches demonstrating the utility of D-Wave quantum annealer and quantum-inspired annealer, i.e., Fujitsu Digital Annealer on various applications, but few works are comparing these platforms. In this paper, we benchmark quantum(-inspired) annealers with three combinatorial optimisation problems ranging from generic scientific problems to complex problems in practical use. In the case where the problem size goes beyond the capacity of a quantum(-inspired) computer, we evaluate them in the context of decomposition. Experiments suggest that both annealers are effective on problems with small size and simple settings, but lose their utility when facing problems in practical size and settings. Decomposition methods extend the scalability of annealers, but they are still far away from practical use. Based on the experiments and comparison, we discuss the advantages and limitations of quantum(-inspired) annealers, as well as the research directions that may improve the utility and scalability of the these emerging computing technologies.},

abstract={The performance of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm is evaluated by using three different measures: the probability of finding the ground state, the energy expectation value, and a ratio closely related to the approximation ratio. The set of problem instances studied consists of weighted MaxCut problems and 2-satisfiability problems. The Ising model representations of the latter possess unique ground states and highly degenerate first excited states. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm is executed on quantum computer simulators and on the IBM Q Experience. Additionally, data obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer are used for comparison, and it is found that the D-Wave machine outperforms the quantum approximate optimization algorithm executed on a simulator. The overall performance of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm is found to strongly depend on the problem instance.},

abstract="Quantum annealing (QA) and Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) are both heuristic quantum algorithms intended for sampling optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. In this article we implement a rigorous direct comparison between QA on D-Wave hardware and QAOA on IBMQ hardware. These two quantum algorithms are also compared against classical simulated annealing. The studied problems are instances of a class of Ising models, with variable assignments of {\$}{\$}+1{\$}{\$}+1or {\$}{\$}-1{\$}{\$}-1, that contain cubic ZZZ interactions (higher order terms) and match both the native connectivity of the Pegasus topology D-Wave chips and the heavy hexagonal lattice of the IBMQ chips. The novel QAOA implementation on the heavy hexagonal lattice has a CNOT depth of 6 per round and allows for usage of an entire heavy hexagonal lattice. Experimentally, QAOA is executed on an ensemble of randomly generated Ising instances with a grid search over 1 and 2 round angles using all 127 programmable superconducting transmon qubits of ibm{\_}washington. The error suppression technique digital dynamical decoupling is also tested on all QAOA circuits. QA is executed on the same Ising instances with the programmable superconducting flux qubit devices D-Wave Advantage{\_}system4.1 and Advantage{\_}system6.1 using modified annealing schedules with pauses. We find that QA outperforms QAOA on all problem instances. We also find that dynamical decoupling enables 2-round QAOA to marginally outperform 1-round QAOA, which is not the case without dynamical decoupling.",

This paper presents a simulated annealing (SA)-based heuristic for the BQP. The new SA heuristic for the BQP is based on a simple (1-opt) local search heuristic and designed with a simple cooling schedule, but the multiple annealing processes are adopted. To show practical performances of the SA, we test on publicly available benchmark instances of large size ranging from 500 to 2500 variables and compare them with other heuristics such as multi-start local search, the previous SA, tabu search, and genetic algorithm incorporating the 1-opt local search. Computational results indicate that our SA leads to high-quality solutions with short times and is more effective than the competitors particularly for the largest benchmark set. Furthermore, the values of new best-known solutions found by the SA for several large instances are also reported.}

abstract = {A quantum system will stay near its instantaneous ground state if the Hamiltonian that governs its evolution varies slowly enough. This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems.}
